Use a custom implementation of a Queue.

All of these classes are used in concert to support and create the Simulation of the data.

There is also a Graphical User Interface (GUI) and a DataBase writtten in mySQL that I will upload once I find them.....

There are also binary tree and red and black tree classes I wrote for the Simulation to test That I neever implemented. Will also add these to this Repo.
