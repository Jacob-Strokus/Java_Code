The program runs by reading in a csv file seperated by Order number, color of gizmolio, Time(in hours), Purchasers name, Penalty for order being late, when the order arrived(month/day/year hours), and when the order was requested(month/day/year hours), in that order.An example of the file wanted is below. 

Order_1,Red Gismolio,10,Mike Smith,50,2/20/2019 1400,2/21/2019 1200
Order_2,Blue Gismolio,18,Joe Miller,70,2/20/2019 1800,2/21/2019 1200
Order_3,Red Gismolio,10,Jan Michaels,120,2/21/2019 800,2/26/2019 1200
Order_4,Green Gismolio,32,Joe Miller,70,2/21/2019 1400,2/22/2019 1200
Order_5,Orange Gismolio,15,Sam Toller,50,2/21/2019 1800,2/22/2019 1200
Order_6,Blue Gismolio,18,Mike Smith,50,2/22/2019 1200,2/23/2019 1200

The program works by testing several algorithms which are first in first out, last in last out, and prioritizing by earliest due date. It tests to see which of these algorithms will cause the highest total penalty to occur, based on if the order was able to be finished by the date requested. 
When viewing the output data you will see each order, when it was processed and the total penalty of each algorithm. If an algorithm was not able to finish an order on time then the penalty would be added. Included are example .csv files generated by the program after processing all orders in the sample data file.
