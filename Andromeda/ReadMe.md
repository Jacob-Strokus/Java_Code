This is a 3D video game programmed in Java using Lightweight Java Game Library in conjuction with OpenGL and OpenAl.

I present to you, Andromeda.

This was a massive undertaking that I spent several weeks creating. I did have help with it thanks "thinMatrix". 
Carl, you are the man. Keep up the great work and thank you for the most helpful series of tutorials that allowed me to bring my code to life. 

This is still a work in progress and I don't think It will ever be "finished".
